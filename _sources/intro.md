This is the website for the Rensselaer class *Quantitative Methods for Business*.

Hi, I'm professor Jason Kuruzovich (you can use professor Jason or just Jason is fine). During these challenging times I'm going to do my best to provide an engaging learning experience. We will be useing a combination of tools for the class and I wanted to provide that overview here.

For class this semster, thank you in advance for complying with RPI mask policies. The science is solid and we want to all get through the semester heathy and without incident.

Here is a quick reference for the systems that will be used in the class.  Please download the desktop copy of both Webex Meetings and Webex Teams via this [link](https://www.webex.com/downloads.html).

## Webex Meetings: Hybrid Class Streaming  
We will be using Webex Meetings to stream all classes.  The course recordings be made available through this website.

## Webex Teams: Classroom and Asyncronous Discussions and Questions
I want to be very responsive to your questions and concerns as we go through the class.  Webex Teams *(NOT EMAIL)* is the best way to reach me.  I would suggest downloading the Webex Teams application for your phone and desktop.  Because Webex meeting chats do not persist, we are going to use the webex teams space for text discussions even when streaming from Webex meetings.
